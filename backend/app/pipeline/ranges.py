"""Resolve the reference range for a result, and flag it against that range.

Priority order, and the first one is the one most implementations get wrong:

1. The range printed on that PDF. Reference intervals are instrument- and
   assay-specific -- LabCorp's ferritin range legitimately differs from
   Quest's, and both differ from a hospital's. The lab's own printed range
   beats any table we could build, because it is the range that lab's
   pathologist actually signed off on.
2. A built-in demographic table, keyed by LOINC + sex + age, used only when
   the PDF omits a range entirely.
3. Nothing. Flag `unknown` rather than inventing an interval.

`ref_source` records which of the three applied, so the UI can show whether a
band came from the user's actual lab or from our fallback.

    The two range sources are written in **different units**, and this is the

    - a **printed** range came off the report in the lab's own units, so it
      compares against the raw value exactly as printed;
    - a **builtin** range is written in the canonical unit, so it compares
      against the converted value.

    Getting this wrong is silent and severe. A creatinine of 80 µmol/L with no
    printed range was compared against the built-in 0.74-1.35 **mg/dL** and
    came back `high`; it is 0.90 mg/dL, squarely normal. Non-US reports print
    µmol/L routinely and often omit the interval, so this was not exotic.

    A builtin range with no canonical value is **not** applied. That happens
    when the unit has no audited conversion, and comparing across an unknown
    conversion is the failure the whole unit table exists to prevent — better
    `unknown` than a confident wrong flag.
